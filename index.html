            <p>Lorem Ipsum is a filler text commonly used in the design and typesetting industry. It has its roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, called "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero. The text is used to give an idea of how the layout of a page or a website will look once the actual content is added.</p>

      <p id="p1">Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist, widely acknowledged to be one of the greatest and most influential physicists of all time. Einstein is best known for developing the theory of relativity, but he also made important contributions to the development of the theory of quantum mechanics.</p>

          <p><b>Legend has it that Einstein was a poor student who flunked out of school, but this was not the case. He excelled at math and science, though he often got only mediocre grades in other classes.</b></p>
          <p>When Albert was 15, his family moved to Milan, Italy. Albert had only one year left in high school, so he stayed behind. But by this time, he had already developed a profound distrust of authority and a hatred of conformity. He loathed Germany's rigid education system, which was based upon rote learning.</p>
          <p>"It's a true miracle," he commented years later, "that modern education hasn't yet completely smothered the curiosity necessary for scientific study."</p>
          <p>If Albert had remained in Germany until he was 16, he would have been obliged to perform military service. The sight of soldiers marching through the streets had always frightened and appalled him, and he was not willing to join them. So Einstein left high school and Germany, and joined his family in Milan.</p>
